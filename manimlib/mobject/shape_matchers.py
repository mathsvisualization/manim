class SurroundingRectangle(Rectangle):
    """
    A rectangle that automatically resizes and repositions itself to surround
    a specified mobject, with a configurable buffer around its boundary.

    SurroundingRectangle is useful for highlighting, emphasizing, or visually
    grouping an object in a scene. It inherits the geometry and styling
    capabilities of :class:`Rectangle`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mobject : Mobject
        The mobject to surround. The rectangle is sized and positioned around
        this object during initialization.
    buff : float, optional
        Extra spacing between the surrounded mobject and the rectangle's
        boundary. Defaults to ``SMALL_BUFF``.
    color : ManimColor, optional
        The rectangle's color. Defaults to ``YELLOW``.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded to :class:`Rectangle`, allowing
        other supported rectangle properties to be configured.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mobject : Mobject
        The object currently being surrounded.
    buff : float
        The buffer used when positioning and sizing the rectangle.

    Methods
    -------
    surround(mobject, buff=None)
        Updates the target object and adjusts the rectangle to surround it.
        If ``buff`` is ``None``, the existing buffer is retained. Returns self.

    set_buff(buff)
        Updates the buffer and repositions and resizes the rectangle around
        the currently stored mobject. Returns self.

    Notes
    -----
    - The constructor immediately calls ``surround(mobject)`` to fit the
      rectangle around the target.
    - If the target is fixed in the frame, the rectangle is also fixed in
      the frame using ``fix_in_frame()``.
    - Calling ``surround()`` changes the stored target and can optionally
      change the buffer.
    - Calling ``set_buff()`` changes the spacing without changing the target.
    - The class inherits other geometry and styling methods from
      :class:`Rectangle`.
    - SurroundingRectangle does not automatically track later transformations
      of the target. To update the rectangle, call ``surround()`` again or
      use an appropriate updater.

    Examples
    --------
    Surround a text object with a yellow rectangle::

        text = Tex("Hello, Manim")
        rect = SurroundingRectangle(text)
        self.add(text, rect)

    Choose a custom buffer and color::

        text = Tex("Important")
        rect = SurroundingRectangle(
            text,
            buff=0.2,
            color=RED,
            stroke_width=3,
        )
        self.add(text, rect)

    Change the buffer after construction::

        text = Tex("Math")
        rect = SurroundingRectangle(text, buff=0.1)
        rect.set_buff(0.4)

    Surround a different object::

        first = Circle()
        second = Square()
        rect = SurroundingRectangle(first)
        rect.surround(second, buff=0.2)

class BackgroundRectangle(SurroundingRectangle):
    """
    A rectangle designed to provide a filled background behind a mobject.

    BackgroundRectangle inherits from :class:`SurroundingRectangle` and is
    commonly used to improve text readability, highlight content, or place
    a translucent background behind objects. By default, it uses the camera's
    background color, has no visible stroke, and has a partially opaque fill.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mobject : Mobject
        The mobject to surround with the background rectangle.
    color : ManimColor or None, optional
        The background rectangle's color. If ``None``, uses
        ``manim_config.camera.background_color``.
    stroke_width : float, optional
        Stroke width passed to the parent constructor. Defaults to ``0``.
        The overridden ``set_style()`` method forces the stroke width to zero.
    stroke_opacity : float, optional
        Stroke opacity passed to the parent constructor. Defaults to ``0``.
        The overridden ``set_style()`` method does not preserve this setting.
    fill_opacity : float, optional
        Initial fill opacity. Defaults to ``0.75``. This value is also stored
        as ``original_fill_opacity``.
    buff : float, optional
        Extra spacing around the target mobject. Defaults to ``0``, so the
        rectangle closely fits the target.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded through
        :class:`SurroundingRectangle` to :class:`Rectangle`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    original_fill_opacity : float
        The fill opacity provided during initialization. Used by
        ``pointwise_become_partial()`` to calculate the opacity of a partial
        representation.

    Methods
    -------
    pointwise_become_partial(mobject, a, b)
        Sets the fill opacity to ``b * original_fill_opacity`` and returns
        this object. The ``mobject`` and ``a`` arguments are not used by
        this implementation.

    set_style(stroke_color=None, stroke_width=None, fill_color=None,
              fill_opacity=None, family=True, **kwargs)
        Applies a fixed style through ``VMobject.set_style()``: black stroke
        color, zero stroke width, and black fill color. Only the supplied
        ``fill_opacity`` is forwarded. Other style arguments, including
        ``stroke_color``, ``stroke_width``, ``fill_color``, ``family``, and
        additional keyword arguments, do not change this fixed style.

    get_fill_color()
        Returns ``Color(self.color)``. This reports the object's ``color``
        attribute converted to a ``Color`` object; it does not directly query
        the fill color set by ``set_style()``.

    Notes
    -----
    - If ``color`` is omitted or ``None``, the rectangle takes its initial
      color from the configured camera background color.
    - The default buffer is zero, unlike the nonzero default used by
      ``SurroundingRectangle``.
    - ``original_fill_opacity`` preserves the initialization value even if
      the fill opacity is later changed.
    - ``pointwise_become_partial()`` uses the parameter ``b`` as a multiplier
      of the original opacity; it does not interpolate between ``a`` and
      ``b`` in this implementation.
    - The overridden ``set_style()`` intentionally restricts styling to a
      black fill and an invisible stroke, with configurable fill opacity.
    - Although the constructor accepts a ``color`` argument, ``get_fill_color()``
      returns the object's ``color`` attribute, which may differ from the
      black fill color explicitly applied by ``set_style()``.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a background rectangle behind text::

        text = Tex("Background")
        background = BackgroundRectangle(text)
        self.add(background, text)

    Specify a color and opacity::

        text = Tex("Highlighted text")
        background = BackgroundRectangle(
            text,
            color=BLUE,
            fill_opacity=0.5,
            buff=0.1,
        )
        self.add(background, text)

    Change the fill opacity::

        background = BackgroundRectangle(Tex("Example"))
        background.set_style(fill_opacity=0.3)

class Cross(VGroup):
    """
    A cross-shaped group of two diagonal lines used to mark, reject, or cross
    out a mobject in a scene.

    Cross consists of two diagonal lines forming an X. The group is initially
    constructed from unit-diagonal lines, then resized to match the supplied
    mobject's bounding box and styled with the requested stroke color and width.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mobject : Mobject
        The mobject whose position and dimensions determine the cross's
        placement and size.
    stroke_color : ManimColor, optional
        Color applied to both diagonal lines. Defaults to ``RED``.
    stroke_width : float or Sequence[float], optional
        Stroke width passed to ``set_stroke()``. Defaults to ``[0, 6, 0]``.
        A sequence can specify different widths across the curves according
        to Manim's stroke-width handling.
    **kwargs
        Accepted by the constructor signature but not forwarded or otherwise
        used in this implementation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    Inherited from VGroup
        The two diagonal Line objects are stored as the group's submobjects.

    Notes
    -----
    - The two lines run from ``UL`` to ``DR`` and from ``UR`` to ``DL``,
      forming an X.
    - ``insert_n_curves(20)`` increases the curve structure before resizing
      and styling the group.
    - ``replace(mobject, stretch=True)`` positions and resizes the cross to
      match the target mobject's bounding box, allowing independent horizontal
      and vertical stretching.
    - The target mobject is not added to the group; it is used only to
      determine the cross's size and position.
    - The default stroke-width sequence is applied to the group's curves
      through ``set_stroke()``.
    - This constructor does not explicitly set a fill style or create an
      updater, so the cross does not automatically follow later transformations
      of the target mobject.

    Examples
    --------
    Cross out a text object::

        text = Tex("Incorrect")
        cross = Cross(text)
        self.add(text, cross)

    Customize the cross color and width::

        shape = Square()
        cross = Cross(
            shape,
            stroke_color=BLUE,
            stroke_width=4,
        )
        self.add(shape, cross)

    Cross out a larger object::

        circle = Circle(radius=2)
        cross = Cross(circle, stroke_color=RED)
        self.add(circle, cross)
