class Checkmark(TexTextFromPresetString):
    """
    A preset LaTeX text mobject that displays a checkmark symbol.

    Checkmark inherits from TexTextFromPresetString and uses the LaTeX command
    R"\ding{51}" to render a checkmark. Its default color is GREEN, making it
    suitable for indicating correctness, completion, approval, or a successful
    condition in a scene.

    The class provides a convenient alternative to manually creating a text
    mobject containing the checkmark command. Since the symbol and default color
    are defined as class attributes, instances use this preset configuration
    unless the inherited implementation or supplied arguments override it.

    Class Attributes

    Example
    -------
        check = Checkmark()
        self.add(check)

    Display a checkmark beside a statement:

class Lightbulb(SVGMobject):
    """
    An SVG-based lightbulb mobject for visually representing ideas, insights,
    creativity, or a source of illumination in a ManimGL scene.

    Lightbulb inherits from SVGMobject and loads the SVG asset identified by
    the class attribute file_name = "lightbulb". It exposes convenient
    parameters for controlling the symbol's height, color, stroke width, and
    fill opacity.

    After initializing the SVG mobject, the constructor calls insert_n_curves(25)
    to increase the number of curves in its vector geometry. This can provide
    additional curve segments for operations that work on the mobject's paths,
    depending on the underlying SVGMobject implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    height : float, optional
        Desired height of the lightbulb mobject. Defaults to 1.0.

    color : ManimColor, optional
        Color applied to the SVG mobject. Defaults to YELLOW.

    stroke_width : float, optional
        Width of the SVG outlines. Defaults to 3.0.

    fill_opacity : float, optional
        Opacity of the SVG fill. Defaults to 0.0, making the fill fully
        transparent under the usual opacity convention.

    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded to SVGMobject.

    Class Attributes
    ----------------
    file_name : str
        Set to "lightbulb", identifying the SVG asset loaded by the parent
        class. The actual file resolution depends on SVGMobject's asset-loading
        implementation.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a default lightbulb:

        bulb = Lightbulb()
        self.add(bulb)

    Change its size and color:

        bulb = Lightbulb(height=2.0, color=YELLOW)
        self.add(bulb)

    Use a transparent fill with a visible outline:

        bulb = Lightbulb(
            height=1.5,
            color=BLUE,
            stroke_width=4.0,
            fill_opacity=0.0,
        )
        self.add(bulb)

    Notes
    -----
    - Lightbulb is an SVG-based vector mobject, not a raster image.
    - The availability and appearance of the graphic depend on the SVG asset
      referenced by file_name.
    - insert_n_curves(25) modifies the vector geometry after initialization.
      Its exact effect depends on how SVGMobject implements curve subdivision.
    - A fill_opacity of 0.0 makes the fill transparent; it does not by itself
      guarantee that every part of the SVG is outline-only, since the SVG's
      paths and inherited styling also affect rendering.

class Speedometer(VMobject):
    """
    A visual speedometer mobject consisting of an arc, tick marks, numeric labels,
    and a rotatable needle.

    Speedometer inherits from VMobject and constructs a gauge-like display for
    representing a numeric velocity value. The gauge contains an arc spanning
    the configured angular range, evenly spaced tick marks, labels increasing
    in increments of ten, and a triangular needle that indicates the current
    reading.

    The needle can be rotated directly or positioned to represent a velocity
    using move_needle_to_velocity(). The latter maps the supplied velocity to
    an angular position based on the number of ticks and the total arc angle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arc_angle : float, optional
        Total angular span of the gauge arc, in radians. Defaults to 4 * PI / 3,
        corresponding to 240 degrees. The arc is centered around the upward
        direction.

    num_ticks : int, optional
        Number of tick marks and numeric labels distributed across the arc.
        Defaults to 8. The labels are generated as 0, 10, 20, and so on.

    tick_length : float, optional
        Length of each tick mark, measured radially in the gauge's local
        coordinate system. Defaults to 0.2. It also determines the height of
        each numeric label and contributes to the labels' placement.

    needle_width : float, optional
        Width of the triangular needle after it is stretched to fit the
        requested width. Defaults to 0.1.

    needle_height : float, optional
        Height of the triangular needle after it is stretched to fit the
        requested height. Defaults to 0.8.

    needle_color : ManimColor, optional
        Fill color of the needle. Defaults to YELLOW.

    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded to VMobject initialization.

    Attributes
    ----------
    arc_angle : float
        Angular span of the gauge arc, in radians.

    num_ticks : int
        Number of tick marks and numeric labels.

    tick_length : float
        Radial length of the tick marks.

    needle_width : float
        Configured width of the needle.

    needle_height : float
        Configured height of the needle.

    needle_color : ManimColor
        Configured fill color of the needle.

    arc : Arc
        Arc forming the curved scale of the speedometer.

    needle : Polygon
        Triangular polygon that indicates the current reading.

    center_offset : np.ndarray
        Center position recorded after the gauge has been constructed. The
        overridden get_center() method uses this offset to provide a stable
        reference center relative to the initial geometry.

    Construction
    ------------
    The arc begins at PI / 2 + arc_angle / 2 and extends through a negative
    angle of arc_angle, ending at PI / 2 - arc_angle / 2. This places the
    gauge's angular range symmetrically around the upward direction.

    The tick marks are positioned using evenly spaced angles generated by
    numpy.linspace(). Each tick extends radially from (1 - tick_length) times
    its direction vector to the direction vector itself.

    Each tick receives an Integer label equal to ten times its zero-based
    index. The label is resized to tick_length in height and placed farther
    from the origin than the tick mark.

    The needle is created from a triangular Polygon, stretched to the requested
    width and height, and rotated to align with the starting angle of the gauge.
    The resulting polygon is stored in self.needle for subsequent manipulation.

    Methods
    -------
    get_center()
        Returns the center of the VMobject's current geometry, adjusted by
        center_offset when that attribute exists. This compensates for the
        initial center recorded during construction and provides a reference
        center for needle-angle calculations.

    get_needle_tip()
        Returns the second anchor point from the needle's anchor array. Given
        the needle polygon's construction, this point represents its intended
        tip. The result is a point in the scene's coordinate system.

    get_needle_angle()
        Calculates the angle, in radians, of the vector from the speedometer's
        adjusted center to the needle tip. The angle is obtained using
        angle_of_vector().

    rotate_needle(angle)
        Rotates the needle by the specified angle in radians around the center
        of the arc, then returns self. The argument is a relative rotation,
        not an absolute target angle.

    move_needle_to_velocity(velocity)
        Maps a velocity value to a target needle angle and rotates the needle
        to that position. The maximum velocity is calculated as
        10 * (num_ticks - 1). The input is divided by this maximum to obtain
        a proportion of the gauge's range. The target angle is then calculated
        by moving from the starting angle through arc_angle times that
        proportion. The method returns self.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a speedometer with the default configuration:

        speedometer = Speedometer()
        self.add(speedometer)

    Move the needle to represent a velocity:

        speedometer.move_needle_to_velocity(40)

    Rotate the needle by a relative angle:

        speedometer.rotate_needle(PI / 6)

    Create a gauge with a different angular range and needle color:

        speedometer = Speedometer(
            arc_angle=PI,
            num_ticks=6,
            needle_color=RED,
        )
        self.add(speedometer)

    Notes
    -----
    - All angular values are expressed in radians.
    - The default configuration has eight ticks, with labels from 0 to 70.
    - The maximum velocity used by move_needle_to_velocity() is derived from
      num_ticks. It is not an independently configurable parameter.
    - The velocity-to-angle mapping is linear. The method does not clamp
      velocity values to the nominal range, so values outside the range can
      rotate the needle beyond the endpoints of the arc.
    - A zero or single tick count makes the velocity mapping invalid because
      max_velocity becomes zero. A practical configuration should use at least
      two ticks.
    - Numeric labels are generated from tick indices rather than from a
      separately supplied scale.
    - The adjusted center is based on center_offset captured after construction.
      Subsequent transformations of the entire mobject may affect how this
      reference behaves, depending on the base VMobject transformation logic.
    - rotate_needle() rotates around arc.get_arc_center(), whereas
      get_needle_angle() measures the needle angle relative to get_center().
      These centers are expected to coincide for the intended gauge layout.

class Laptop(VGroup):
    """
    A three-dimensional laptop model composed of a base, keyboard, hinged screen,
    and hinge-axis indicator.

    Laptop inherits from VGroup and constructs a stylized laptop using ManimGL
    vector mobjects. The base is created from a VCube and reshaped according to
    the requested body dimensions. A grid of square mobjects represents the
    keyboard, while a thin screen plate supports a black rectangular screen.

    The screen plate is positioned at the back of the laptop body and rotated
    around its bottom edge to represent an open laptop. The open angle can be
    customized to create different screen positions.

    The assembled laptop is stored as a group, allowing it to be positioned,
    scaled, rotated, and animated as a single object. References to the screen,
    screen plate, and hinge-axis indicator are also exposed for individual
    manipulation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    width : float, optional
        Target width of the laptop body after its initial dimensions have been
        applied. Defaults to 3. The body is resized to this width while
        preserving the proportions established by its preceding stretch
        operations.

    body_dimensions : Tuple[float, float, float], optional
        Initial scale dimensions applied to the VCube along its three coordinate
        axes, in x-, y-, and z-dimension order. Defaults to (4.0, 3.0, 0.05).
        These values determine the base's proportions before its width is set
        to the requested width.

    screen_thickness : float, optional
        Thickness used when reshaping the screen plate along the z-axis.
        Defaults to 0.01. The implementation calculates a stretch factor by
        dividing this value by body_dimensions[2].

    keyboard_width_to_body_width : float, optional
        Ratio between the keyboard's target width and the laptop body's width.
        Defaults to 0.9.

    keyboard_height_to_body_height : float, optional
        Ratio between the keyboard's target height and the laptop body's height.
        Defaults to 0.5.

    screen_width_to_screen_plate_width : float, optional
        Scale factor applied to the screen rectangle relative to the screen
        plate's width. Defaults to 0.9.

    key_color_kwargs : dict, optional
        Keyword arguments passed to each Square used to construct the keyboard
        keys. Defaults to a dictionary with stroke_width=0, fill_color=BLACK,
        and fill_opacity=1. These settings produce solid black keys without
        visible outlines under the usual rendering conventions.

    fill_opacity : float, optional
        Accepted as a constructor parameter, with a default of 1.0. In this
        implementation, the value is not explicitly applied to the body, screen,
        keyboard, or other generated components.

    stroke_width : float, optional
        Accepted as a constructor parameter, with a default of 0.0. In this
        implementation, the value is not explicitly applied to the generated
        components as a general stroke-width setting.

    body_color : ManimColor, optional
        Fill color applied to the final submobject in the sorted body geometry.
        Defaults to GREY_B.

    shaded_body_color : ManimColor, optional
        Fill color initially applied to the body geometry. Defaults to GREY.
        The body is sorted by the z-coordinate of its points before the final
        submobject receives body_color.

    open_angle : float, optional
        Angle, in radians, through which the screen plate is rotated around the
        RIGHT axis at its bottom edge. Defaults to pi / 4, or 45 degrees.

    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded to VGroup initialization.

    Attributes
    ----------
    screen_plate : VGroup or VMobject
        The copied body geometry used as the laptop's screen frame or plate.
        The screen rectangle is added to this object before the plate is rotated.

    screen : Rectangle
        Black rectangular mobject representing the laptop display. It is exposed
        separately so it can be recolored, replaced, or otherwise manipulated.

    axis : Line
        A black line drawn between the body's upper-left-front and
        upper-right-front corners. It serves as a visual indicator of the
        laptop's hinge axis.

    Construction
    ------------
    1. Create a unit VCube and stretch it along each coordinate dimension using
       body_dimensions.
    2. Set the body's width to width, then apply the shaded body fill color.
    3. Sort the body's submobjects according to their point z-coordinates and
       apply body_color to the final submobject.
    4. Copy the body to create the screen plate.
    5. Construct a keyboard from four rows of Square mobjects. Alternate row
       lengths between 12 and 11 keys, arrange the keys horizontally, and arrange
       the rows vertically.
    6. Resize the keyboard using the width and height ratios, position it just
       above the body, and add it to the body group.
    7. Adjust the screen plate's thickness, create a black Rectangle, and fit
       the rectangle to the plate before applying the screen width ratio.
    8. Position the screen in front of the plate, add it to the plate, and place
       the plate at the back edge of the body.
    9. Rotate the plate around its bottom edge by open_angle to represent the
       open display.
    10. Create the hinge-axis Line and add the body, screen plate, and axis to
        the Laptop group.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a laptop using the default dimensions:

        laptop = Laptop()
        self.add(laptop)

    Create a wider laptop:

        laptop = Laptop(width=4.0)
        self.add(laptop)

    Customize the screen opening angle:

        laptop = Laptop(open_angle=PI / 3)
        self.add(laptop)

    Customize the body and screen colors:

        laptop = Laptop(
            body_color=BLUE,
            shaded_body_color=GREY,
            open_angle=PI / 4,
        )
        self.add(laptop)

    Access and manipulate the screen separately:

        laptop = Laptop()
        laptop.screen.set_fill(WHITE, opacity=1)
        self.add(laptop)

    Notes
    -----
    - The laptop is a stylized vector construction, not a detailed physical
      model. Its appearance depends on the dimensions, colors, and rendering
      behavior of the component mobjects.
    - body_dimensions[2] must be nonzero because it is used as the denominator
      when calculating the screen plate's thickness stretch factor.
    - body_dimensions is expected to contain three values corresponding to the
      three coordinate dimensions.
    - The keyboard contains four rows with alternating counts of 12 and 11
      square keys. It does not model a complete physical keyboard layout.
    - The screen is a black Rectangle fitted to the screen plate before being
      scaled to screen_width_to_screen_plate_width.
    - The screen plate rotates around its bottom edge. The resulting orientation
      depends on the initial geometry and the supplied open_angle.
    - fill_opacity and stroke_width are accepted but are not explicitly applied
      to the constructed components by this implementation.
    - body_color is applied to body[-1] after sorting; the exact face or component
      receiving that color depends on the submobject structure of VCube and the
      behavior of sort().
    - The hinge-axis indicator is added as a separate group member and is not
      itself rotated as part of the screen-plate rotation.
    - The body, screen plate, and axis are all included in the parent VGroup, so
      transformations applied to the complete Laptop affect these components
      together.

    The bubble body is loaded from an SVG asset and resized to accommodate
    its content. The class supports custom fill and stroke styling, optional
    content display, directional flipping, positioning, and content resizing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    content : str | VMobject | None, optional
        Content to associate with the bubble. A string is converted to a
        Text object, while a VMobject is used directly. If None, a transparent
        rectangle is created using filler_shape to determine the initial
        bubble dimensions. Defaults to None.
    buff : float, optional
        Extra spacing used when calculating the bubble body's dimensions
        around the content. Defaults to 1.0.
    filler_shape : Tuple[float, float], optional
        Width and height of the placeholder rectangle created when content
        is None. Defaults to (3.0, 2.0).
    pin_point : Vect3 | None, optional
        Point or mobject accepted by pin_to() to position the bubble's tip.
        If provided, the bubble is pinned during initialization. Defaults
        to None.
    direction : Vect3, optional
        Direction used to orient the bubble's tip and determine its initial
        horizontal orientation. Defaults to LEFT.
    add_content : bool, optional
        Whether to add the content mobject to the visible VGroup during
        initialization. The content is still stored in self.content when
        this is False. Defaults to True.
    fill_color : ManimColor, optional
        Fill color of the bubble body. Defaults to BLACK.
    fill_opacity : float, optional
        Fill opacity of the bubble body. Defaults to 0.8.
    stroke_color : ManimColor, optional
        Outline color of the bubble body. Defaults to WHITE.
    stroke_width : float, optional
        Outline width of the bubble body. Defaults to 3.0.
    **kwargs
        Additional arguments passed to VGroup.

    Attributes
    ----------
    file_name : str
        SVG asset used to construct the bubble body. Defaults to
        "Bubbles_speech.svg".
    bubble_center_adjustment_factor : float
        Vertical adjustment factor used when positioning the body relative
        to its content and when calculating the bubble's content center.
        Defaults to 0.125.
    direction : Vect3
        Direction associated with the bubble's tip and orientation.
    content : VMobject
        Mobject displayed inside the bubble, or stored as its content.
    body : VMobject
        SVG-based speech bubble body, including its fill and outline.

    Methods
    -------
    get_body(content, direction, buff)
        Creates and sizes the SVG bubble body around the supplied content.
    get_tip()
        Returns the bubble's tip position, determined from its lower corner
        and current direction.
    get_bubble_center()
        Returns the adjusted center intended for positioning content inside
        the bubble.
    move_tip_to(point)
        Shifts the bubble so that its tip reaches the specified point.
    flip(axis=UP, only_body=True, **kwargs)
        Flips the bubble and optionally its content, updating direction
        when the flip axis has a nonzero y component.
    pin_to(mobject, auto_flip=False)
        Positions the bubble's tip relative to a target mobject's bounding
        box. Optionally flips the bubble when the target is on the opposite
        horizontal side.
    position_mobject_inside(mobject, buff=MED_LARGE_BUFF)
        Resizes and positions a mobject to fit inside the bubble body.
    add_content(mobject)
        Positions the supplied mobject inside the bubble, stores it as
        self.content, and returns that mobject. This method does not itself
        add the mobject to the VGroup.
    write(text)
        Creates a Text object and passes it to add_content(), then returns
        the bubble. The new text is not automatically added to the VGroup
        by this method.
    resize_to_content(buff=1.0)
        Updates the body's points to match a newly calculated body shape
        around the current content. This method currently has no explicit
        return value.
    clear()
        Removes self.content from the VGroup and returns the bubble.
        It does not reset self.content.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a bubble containing text:

        bubble = Bubble("Hello!")
        self.add(bubble)

    Create a bubble with custom styling:

        bubble = Bubble(
            "Hello!",
            buff=0.5,
            fill_color=BLUE_E,
            fill_opacity=0.9,
            stroke_color=WHITE,
            stroke_width=2,
        )
        self.add(bubble)

    Create an empty bubble with a chosen placeholder size:

        bubble = Bubble(
            content=None,
            filler_shape=(4.0, 2.5),
            direction=LEFT,
        )
        self.add(bubble)

    Position the tip at a chosen point:

        bubble = Bubble("Look here!")
        bubble.move_tip_to(2 * LEFT + UP)
        self.add(bubble)

    Pin a bubble toward another mobject:

        target = Circle()
        bubble = Bubble("Target", direction=LEFT)
        bubble.pin_to(target, auto_flip=True)
        self.add(target, bubble)

    Flip a bubble:

        bubble = Bubble("Hello!")
        bubble.flip(axis=UP)
        self.add(bubble)

    Replace the bubble's content:

        bubble = Bubble("Old text")
        new_text = Text("New text")
        bubble.add_content(new_text)
        bubble.add(new_text)

    Add text using the write helper:

        bubble = Bubble()
        bubble.write("Hello!")
        bubble.add(bubble.content)

    Notes
    -----
    - The SVG asset must be available to SVGMobject for the bubble body
      to render correctly.
    - When content is None, the placeholder rectangle is transparent and
      has no stroke; it is used to establish the initial body dimensions.
    - The body width is calculated as the content width plus the smaller
      of buff and content height. Its target height is 1.35 times the
      content height plus buff.
    - The bubble body is shifted downward by a fraction of its height to
      account for the tip and visual placement of the SVG.
    - The horizontal direction check in get_body() flips the SVG when
      direction[0] is positive.
    - pin_to() expects a target mobject because it calls get_center() and
      get_bounding_box_point() on its argument. The pin_point annotation
      allows a Vect3, but passing a raw coordinate vector to pin_to()
      will not work with the current implementation.
    - position_mobject_inside() changes the supplied mobject's size and
      position in place.
    - add_content() and write() position and store content but do not
      automatically add the new content to the VGroup.
    - resize_to_content() is marked as unfinished in the implementation.
    - The content and body dimensions may need adjustment for unusual
      aspect ratios, large content, or custom SVG bubble assets.

class SpeechBubble(Bubble):
    """
    A speech bubble built from a rounded rectangle and a triangular stem.

    SpeechBubble inherits from Bubble but overrides the body-generation
    method to construct the bubble using vector geometry instead of an SVG
    asset. The stem is formed by combining a triangle with a rounded
    rectangle, creating a single bubble-shaped VMobject.

    Parameters
    ----------
    content : str | VMobject | None, optional
        Content placed inside the bubble. A string is converted into a
        Text object by the parent Bubble class. If None, a transparent
        placeholder rectangle is created using filler_shape. Defaults to None.
    buff : float, optional
        Spacing around the content when constructing the rounded rectangle.
        Defaults to MED_SMALL_BUFF.
    filler_shape : Tuple[float, float], optional
        Width and height of the placeholder rectangle used when content is
        None. Defaults to (2.0, 1.0).
    stem_height_to_bubble_height : float, optional
        Multiplier applied to the rounded rectangle's height to determine
        the triangular stem's height. Defaults to 0.5.
    stem_top_x_props : Tuple[float, float], optional
        Two proportions specifying the stem's attachment points along the
        rectangle's bottom edge. The first value determines the left
        attachment point and the second determines the right attachment
        point. Defaults to (0.2, 0.3).
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments passed through Bubble to VGroup,
        including options for direction, fill, stroke, and positioning.

    Attributes
    ----------
    stem_height_to_bubble_height : float
        Ratio used to calculate the stem height relative to the rectangle.
    stem_top_x_props : Tuple[float, float]
        Proportions defining where the stem attaches to the bottom edge.
    content : VMobject
        Content managed by the parent Bubble class.
    body : VMobject
        Combined rounded-rectangle and triangular-stem geometry created
        by get_body().

    Methods
    -------
    get_body(content, direction, buff)
        Constructs a rounded rectangle around the content, creates a
        triangular stem extending downward from its bottom-left region,
        combines both shapes using Union, and optionally flips the result
        when direction[0] is positive.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a basic speech bubble:

        bubble = SpeechBubble("Hello!")
        self.add(bubble)

    Customize the bubble's spacing and stem proportions:

        bubble = SpeechBubble(
            "Hello there!",
            buff=0.2,
            stem_height_to_bubble_height=0.4,
            stem_top_x_props=(0.15, 0.35),
        )
        self.add(bubble)

    Use a custom direction and style:

        bubble = SpeechBubble(
            "Look over here!",
            direction=RIGHT,
            fill_color=BLUE_E,
            fill_opacity=0.9,
            stroke_color=WHITE,
            stroke_width=2,
        )
        self.add(bubble)

    Create an empty speech bubble for later content:

        bubble = SpeechBubble(
            content=None,
            filler_shape=(3.0, 1.5),
        )
        self.add(bubble)

    Move the stem tip to a specific point:

        bubble = SpeechBubble("Notice this")
        bubble.move_tip_to(2 * LEFT + DOWN)
        self.add(bubble)

    Notes
    -----
    - The parent Bubble class handles content conversion, body styling,
      optional content addition, and optional pinning.
    - The body is created using SurroundingRectangle, round_corners(),
      Polygon, and Union. Unlike Bubble's default body implementation,
      this method does not load an SVG file.
    - The stem is constructed from three vertices: two points interpolated
      along the rectangle's bottom edge and a third point below its
      bottom-left corner.
    - The stem height is proportional to the rounded rectangle's height.
      Increasing stem_height_to_bubble_height makes the stem longer.
    - stem_top_x_props should normally contain two ordered proportions
      between 0 and 1. Their values control the stem's attachment width
      and position along the bottom edge.
    - The current implementation always places the stem's tip below the
      bottom-left corner, then flips the complete result when direction[0]
      is positive. It does not independently reposition the stem for every
      possible direction vector.
    - insert_n_curves(20) increases the number of curves in the combined
      geometry; it does not directly specify the number of corners or
      the stem's height.
    - The class inherits methods such as get_tip(), get_bubble_center(),
      move_tip_to(), pin_to(), position_mobject_inside(), write(), and
      clear() from Bubble.

class ThoughtBubble(Bubble):
    """
    A thought bubble with an irregular cloud-shaped body and small trailing
    circles to represent a character's thoughts.

    ThoughtBubble inherits from Bubble and overrides get_body() to construct
    the bubble from a rounded rectangular region, overlapping circles, and
    a sequence of smaller circles. Random variation in the circle positions
    and radii gives the main body an irregular, cloud-like outline.

    Parameters
    ----------
    content : str | VMobject | None, optional
        Content to associate with the thought bubble. Strings are converted
        to Text objects by Bubble. If None, a transparent placeholder
        rectangle is created using filler_shape. Defaults to None.
    buff : float, optional
        Spacing between the content and the surrounding rectangle.
        Defaults to SMALL_BUFF.
    filler_shape : Tuple[float, float], optional
        Width and height of the placeholder rectangle used when content is
        None. Defaults to (2.0, 1.0).
    bulge_radius : float, optional
        Base radius of the circles used to form the cloud-like body.
        Defaults to 0.35.
    bulge_overlap : float, optional
        Controls the overlap between neighboring bulges. The spacing
        between their centers is calculated as
        (1 - bulge_overlap) * 2 * bulge_radius. Larger values produce
        more overlap. Defaults to 0.25.
    noise_factor : float, optional
        Controls the amount of random variation in bulge placement and
        radius. A value of 0 removes the random variation. Defaults to 0.1.
    circle_radii : list[float], optional
        Radii of the small circles forming the thought bubble's trailing
        indicator. Defaults to [0.1, 0.15, 0.2].
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments passed through Bubble to VGroup,
        including options for direction, fill, stroke, and positioning.

    Attributes
    ----------
    bulge_radius : float
        Base radius used for the circles forming the cloud outline.
    bulge_overlap : float
        Controls how closely neighboring bulges overlap.
    noise_factor : float
        Amount of random variation applied to the bulge geometry.
    circle_radii : list[float]
        Radii of the circles used for the trailing indicator.
    content : VMobject
        Content managed by the parent Bubble class.
    body : VMobject
        Thought-bubble geometry returned by get_body(). This is a VGroup
        containing the trailing circles and the cloud-shaped body.

    Methods
    -------
    get_body(content, direction, buff)
        Builds the thought bubble by surrounding the content with a
        rectangle, placing overlapping circles along its perimeter,
        combining those shapes with Union, and adding a trail of circles.
        Flips the resulting group when direction[0] is positive.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a basic thought bubble:

        bubble = ThoughtBubble("Hmm...")
        self.add(bubble)

    Customize the cloud outline:

        bubble = ThoughtBubble(
            "What if?",
            bulge_radius=0.3,
            bulge_overlap=0.35,
            noise_factor=0.05,
        )
        self.add(bubble)

    Customize the trailing circles:

        bubble = ThoughtBubble(
            "Thinking",
            circle_radii=[0.08, 0.12, 0.18],
        )
        self.add(bubble)

    Create a thought bubble with custom content spacing:

        bubble = ThoughtBubble(
            "An interesting idea",
            buff=0.2,
            filler_shape=(3.0, 1.5),
        )
        self.add(bubble)

    Position the thought bubble near a mobject:

        target = Circle()
        bubble = ThoughtBubble("A thought")
        bubble.pin_to(target, auto_flip=True)
        self.add(target, bubble)

    Notes
    -----
    - The parent Bubble class handles content conversion, body styling,
      optional content addition, and optional pinning.
    - The main cloud is created by combining a SurroundingRectangle with
      overlapping circles using Union.
    - Circle centers are sampled along the rectangle's perimeter. The
      number of samples depends on the edge lengths and the spacing
      determined by bulge_radius and bulge_overlap.
    - Random variation affects both the sampled positions and the radii
      of the bulging circles. Consequently, separately created instances
      may have slightly different outlines.
    - The trailing circles are arranged diagonally, adjusted, and placed
      below the cloud body. Their radii are taken from circle_radii.
    - The current implementation uses WHITE with stroke width 2 for the
      cloud and trailing circles. The fill styling applied by Bubble is
      applied to the returned body group.
    - The direction check only tests direction[0]. When it is positive,
      the entire result is flipped; other direction components do not
      independently control the tail's orientation.
    - circle_radii is expected to contain at least one value because the
      implementation uses circle_radii[0] to calculate spacing.
    - The local variable perimeter is calculated but not subsequently
      used in the current implementation.
