class SVGMobject(VMobject):
    """
    Convert an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) document into a hierarchy of
    Manim :class:`VMobject` objects.

    ``SVGMobject`` reads SVG markup from a string or file, parses its XML
    structure, converts supported SVG geometry into Manim vector objects,
    preserves applicable SVG styling and transformations, and combines the
    resulting objects into a single :class:`VMobject`-based group.

    It is designed to make vector artwork created in external graphics
    applications usable inside Manim scenes. The resulting object can be
    positioned, scaled, recolored, animated, and manipulated using the usual
    Manim mobject methods.

    The class supports SVG paths, straight lines, rectangles, circles,
    ellipses, polygons, and polylines. SVG groups and ``<use>`` elements are
    not directly converted into separate mobjects by ``mobjects_from_svg``;
    however, referenced path geometry can be resolved when processing paths.

    SVG text conversion is not implemented in this class: ``text_to_mobject``
    is currently a placeholder.

    Class Attributes
    ----------------
    file_name : str
        Default SVG filename used when the constructor receives neither a
        nonempty ``svg_string`` nor a nonempty ``file_name`` argument.
        The default is an empty string.
    height : float or None
        Default target height for the resulting object. The class default is
        ``2.0``. A constructor-level ``height`` overrides it when truthy.
    width : float or None
        Default target width for the resulting object. The class default is
        ``None``, meaning no width-based resizing is requested unless a width
        is supplied explicitly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_name : str, optional
        Name or path identifier of an SVG file to load. The file is resolved
        using ``get_full_vector_image_path``. Defaults to an empty string.
    svg_string : str, optional
        SVG XML markup supplied directly as a string. When nonempty, this
        takes precedence over both the constructor's ``file_name`` and the
        class-level ``self.file_name``.
    should_center : bool, optional
        Whether to center the imported geometry around the origin before
        applying the requested height and width. Defaults to ``True``.
    height : float or None, optional
        Target height of the resulting mobject. If the argument is falsy,
        ``self.height`` is used instead. With the default class configuration,
        the object is resized to a height of 2.0.
    width : float or None, optional
        Target width of the resulting mobject. If the argument is falsy,
        ``self.width`` is used instead. If the effective width is ``None``,
        width-based resizing is skipped.
    color : ManimColor, optional
        General color override applied to both fill and stroke after SVG
        geometry has been imported and resized. The implementation uses
        ``color or fill_color`` for the fill override and
        ``color or stroke_color`` for the stroke override. Consequently, a
        truthy ``color`` takes precedence over the corresponding specific
        color argument.
    fill_color : ManimColor, optional
        Fill color override applied after SVG import. If ``color`` is truthy,
        ``color`` takes precedence over this argument.
    fill_opacity : float or None, optional
        Fill opacity override applied after SVG import. ``None`` leaves the
        corresponding style value unchanged by this final style operation.
    stroke_width : float or None, optional
        Stroke-width override applied after SVG import and geometric resizing.
    stroke_color : ManimColor, optional
        Stroke color override applied after SVG import. If ``color`` is truthy,
        ``color`` takes precedence over this argument.
    stroke_opacity : float or None, optional
        Stroke opacity override applied after SVG import.
    svg_default : dict, optional
        Dictionary specifying fallback/default styling for SVG elements when
        their own styling does not provide a value. The default dictionary
        contains the keys ``color``, ``opacity``, ``fill_color``,
        ``fill_opacity``, ``stroke_width``, ``stroke_color``, and
        ``stroke_opacity``, all initialized to ``None``.

        The dictionary is copied during initialization. Its values are
        converted into SVG style attributes by ``generate_config_style_dict``.
        Only values represented by that method's conversion mapping are
        applied. In particular, the mapping uses ``color`` and ``fill_color``
        for SVG fill, ``color`` and ``stroke_color`` for SVG stroke, and
        ``opacity`` for both fill and stroke opacity.
    path_string_config : dict, optional
        Configuration forwarded to :class:`VMobjectFromSVGPath` when SVG paths
        are converted into Manim vector objects. The dictionary is copied
        during initialization.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments passed to ``VMobject.__init__`` through
        ``super().__init__``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    svg_string : str
        The SVG markup used to construct the mobject.
    svg_default : dict
        A copy of the configured default SVG styling dictionary.
    path_string_config : dict
        A copy of the path-conversion configuration dictionary.
    submobjects : list[VMobject]
        The converted SVG elements contained in the mobject hierarchy.

    Initialization Process
    ----------------------
    The constructor performs the following operations:

    1. Selects the SVG source. A nonempty ``svg_string`` has the highest
       priority, followed by the constructor's ``file_name``, followed by
       the class or instance attribute ``self.file_name``. If all three are
       empty, an exception is raised.
    2. Copies ``svg_default`` and ``path_string_config`` so that the
       instance stores its own dictionaries.
    3. Initializes the parent ``VMobject``.
    4. Parses and converts the SVG through ``init_svg_mobject``.
    5. Calls ``ensure_positive_orientation`` to normalize the orientation
       according to Manim's implementation.
    6. Determines the effective target height and width, records the current
       height, and optionally centers the object.
    7. Resizes the object to the requested height and/or width.
    8. Adjusts stroke widths to account for the geometry's resizing.
    9. Applies the final fill and stroke overrides using ``set_style``.

    The final style overrides are deliberately applied after resizing so that
    a requested stroke width is not unintentionally scaled by the resizing
    operation.

    Source Selection and Caching
    ----------------------------
    The SVG geometry is initialized by ``init_svg_mobject``. Before parsing
    the document, the method calculates a hash from ``hash_seed``.

    The ``hash_seed`` property returns a tuple containing:
        - The class name.
        - The ``svg_default`` dictionary.
        - The ``path_string_config`` dictionary.
        - The SVG markup itself.

    The resulting hash is used as a key in ``SVG_HASH_TO_MOB_MAP``. If a
    matching entry exists, the stored submobjects are copied and reused.
    Otherwise, the SVG markup is parsed and converted, and copies of the
    resulting submobjects are stored in the cache.

    Copying cached submobjects avoids reusing the same mutable mobject
    instances across different ``SVGMobject`` instances.

    After obtaining the submobjects, ``init_svg_mobject`` adds them to the
    object and calls ``flip(RIGHT)`` to reverse the SVG's vertical orientation
    relative to Manim's coordinate system.

    Important: the cache key includes the SVG source and the two configuration
    dictionaries, but not the requested height, width, centering, or final
    style overrides. Those operations are performed after cached geometry is
    retrieved.

    SVG Parsing Pipeline
    --------------------
    The method ``mobjects_from_svg_string`` implements the main parsing
    pipeline:

    1. Parses the XML string into an ``xml.etree.ElementTree``.
    2. Calls ``modify_xml_tree`` to prepare the XML for SVG parsing.
    3. Serializes the modified XML into an in-memory byte stream.
    4. Parses the byte stream with ``svgelements.SVG.parse``.
    5. Calls ``mobjects_from_svg`` to convert supported elements into Manim
       mobjects.

    Malformed XML or SVG content that the underlying parser cannot process
    may raise an exception.

    XML Style Modification
    ----------------------
    ``modify_xml_tree`` creates a new SVG root element and wraps the original
    SVG content in two groups:

    - A configuration-style group containing default style attributes.
    - A root-style group containing selected style attributes from the original
      SVG root.

    The style attributes copied from the original root are:
    ``fill``, ``fill-opacity``, ``stroke``, ``stroke-opacity``,
    ``stroke-width``, and ``style``.

    The method uses ``generate_config_style_dict`` to construct the default
    style attributes. These defaults are represented as SVG group attributes,
    allowing styles specified on individual SVG elements to participate in
    normal SVG style inheritance.

    The method does not copy every original root attribute into the new root.
    Instead, the original root's children are placed inside the newly created
    style groups.

    Default Style Generation
    ------------------------
    ``generate_config_style_dict`` translates selected entries in
    ``self.svg_default`` into SVG presentation attributes:

    - ``fill`` uses ``color`` and ``fill_color``.
    - ``fill-opacity`` uses ``opacity`` and ``fill_opacity``.
    - ``stroke`` uses ``color`` and ``stroke_color``.
    - ``stroke-opacity`` uses ``opacity`` and ``stroke_opacity``.
    - ``stroke-width`` uses ``stroke_width``.

    For each SVG attribute, the method iterates through its associated
    configuration keys and assigns a value when that key is not ``None``.
    Because later keys overwrite earlier ones, ``fill_color`` takes precedence
    over ``color`` for fill, ``fill_opacity`` takes precedence over ``opacity``
    for fill opacity, ``stroke_color`` takes precedence over ``color`` for
    stroke, and ``stroke_opacity`` takes precedence over ``opacity`` for
    stroke opacity.

    The values are converted to strings because SVG presentation attributes
    are textual XML attributes.

    Supported SVG Elements
    ----------------------
    ``mobjects_from_svg`` iterates through the parsed SVG elements and
    dispatches supported element types to their conversion methods.

    Supported types include:

    - ``svgelements.Path``: converted by ``path_to_mobject`` into a
      ``VMobjectFromSVGPath``.
    - ``svgelements.SimpleLine``: converted by ``line_to_mobject`` into a
      Manim ``Line``.
    - ``svgelements.Rect``: converted by ``rect_to_mobject`` into a
      ``Rectangle`` or ``RoundedRectangle``.
    - ``svgelements.Circle`` and ``svgelements.Ellipse``: converted by
      ``ellipse_to_mobject`` into a Manim ``Circle`` whose dimensions are
      adjusted to match the parsed ellipse.
    - ``svgelements.Polygon``: converted by ``polygon_to_mobject`` into a
      Manim ``Polygon``.
    - ``svgelements.Polyline``: converted by ``polyline_to_mobject`` into a
      Manim ``Polyline``.

    ``svgelements.Group`` and ``svgelements.Use`` objects are skipped by
    the main element-dispatch loop. Elements whose exact type is
    ``svgelements.SVGElement`` are also skipped. Unsupported element types
    generate a warning and are ignored.

    The text conversion branch is commented out, so SVG text elements are
    not converted by this dispatch method.

    After conversion, objects without points are discarded. For parsed
    ``GraphicObject`` instances, the SVG fill and stroke properties are
    applied using ``apply_style_to_mobject``. For parsed ``Transformable``
    instances whose ``apply`` attribute is true, their transformation
    matrices are applied using ``handle_transform``.

    The resulting mobjects are returned in a list, which is then added to
    the parent ``SVGMobject``.

    Path Conversion
    ---------------
    ``path_to_mobject`` converts a parsed SVG path into a
    ``VMobjectFromSVGPath``.

    If the path's identifier exists in ``svg.objects``, the method retrieves
    the referenced path geometry and constructs the mobject from that
    geometry. If the current path contains a transform, the transform is
    applied manually to preserve the referenced geometry's precision and
    avoid unnecessarily duplicating entries in ``PATH_TO_POINTS``.

    Otherwise, the method directly constructs ``VMobjectFromSVGPath`` from
    the parsed path.

    The ``path_string_config`` dictionary is forwarded to the path mobject
    constructor in either case.

    Line Conversion
    ---------------
    ``line_to_mobject`` converts an SVG straight line into a Manim ``Line``.
    Its endpoints are converted from SVG coordinates into Manim's 3D
    coordinate representation by ``_convert_point_to_3d``.

    Rectangle Conversion
    --------------------
    ``rect_to_mobject`` converts an SVG rectangle according to its corner
    radius information.

    If either ``rx`` or ``ry`` equals zero, the method creates a standard
    ``Rectangle`` using the parsed width and height.

    Otherwise, it creates a ``RoundedRectangle`` using:
        - The SVG rectangle's width.
        - An initial height adjusted by ``rect.rx / rect.ry``.
        - ``rect.rx`` as the initial corner radius.

    The rounded rectangle is then stretched to the SVG rectangle's actual
    height. Finally, the object is shifted to the converted center point
    of the SVG rectangle.

    Ellipse and Circle Conversion
    -----------------------------
    ``ellipse_to_mobject`` constructs a Manim ``Circle`` using the parsed
    horizontal radius ``ellipse.rx``. It then stretches the circle vertically
    to a height of ``2 * ellipse.ry`` and shifts it to the parsed center.

    For a circular SVG element, the horizontal and vertical radii are equal,
    so the resulting geometry remains circular. For an elliptical element,
    the vertical stretch produces an ellipse-shaped mobject.

    Polygon and Polyline Conversion
    -------------------------------
    ``polygon_to_mobject`` converts each SVG polygon vertex into a Manim
    coordinate and passes the resulting points to ``Polygon``.

    ``polyline_to_mobject`` performs the same coordinate conversion for
    polyline vertices and constructs a Manim ``Polyline``.

    Transformation Handling
    -----------------------
    ``handle_transform`` converts a ``svgelements.Matrix`` into a 2D NumPy
    matrix and a 3D translation vector.

    The linear transformation is applied using ``mob.apply_matrix(mat)``,
    and the translation is applied afterward using ``mob.shift(vec)``.

    The method returns the transformed mobject, allowing the transformation
    operation to be used as part of a conversion pipeline.

    The special transform handling in ``path_to_mobject`` uses a point-wise
    transformation function instead. It applies the referenced path's
    linear transformation and translation directly to the stored points.

    Style Application
    -----------------
    ``apply_style_to_mobject`` applies the fill and stroke properties of a
    parsed SVG graphic object to a Manim mobject.

    The method determines whether a stroke is present by checking whether
    ``shape.stroke`` and its ``hexrgb`` value are not ``None``. When a valid
    stroke color exists, it uses the parsed stroke width, color, and opacity.
    Otherwise, it sets the stroke width to zero.

    This check is important because ``svgelements`` may report a default
    stroke width of ``1.0`` even when the SVG explicitly specifies
    ``stroke: none``.

    The fill color and opacity are obtained from ``shape.fill`` and applied
    to the mobject. The method returns the modified mobject.

    Stroke-Width Scaling
    --------------------
    ``scale_stroke_widths`` adjusts stroke widths throughout the mobject
    family after geometric resizing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    factor : float
        Multiplicative factor applied to each applicable stroke width.

    If ``factor`` equals ``1``, the method returns immediately. Otherwise,
    it traverses ``self.get_family()`` and skips mobjects whose ``data``
    array is empty. This avoids attempting to adjust stroke widths on group
    objects that contain no geometry of their own.

    For every remaining mobject, the method obtains its current stroke widths,
    multiplies them by ``factor``, and applies the result with
    ``recurse=False`` so that the operation is performed on the current
    family member rather than recursively repeating on its descendants.

    The constructor calculates the scaling factor from the final height
    divided by the initial height, multiplied by ``STROKE_WIDTHS_PER_UNIT``.
    This helps keep stroke thickness consistent with the resized SVG artwork.

    Methods
    -------
    scale_stroke_widths(factor)
        Adjust stroke widths across the mobject family by a multiplicative
        factor.
    init_svg_mobject()
        Retrieve cached geometry or parse the SVG, add its submobjects, and
        flip the vertical orientation.
    hash_seed
        Property returning the tuple used to generate the SVG geometry cache
        key.
    mobjects_from_svg_string(svg_string)
        Parse SVG XML markup and return converted Manim mobjects.
    file_name_to_svg_string(file_name)
        Read an SVG file resolved by ``get_full_vector_image_path`` and
        return its contents as a string.
    modify_xml_tree(element_tree)
        Wrap the SVG content in groups that provide configured default
        styling and selected original root styling.
    generate_config_style_dict()
        Convert supported ``svg_default`` entries into SVG presentation
        attributes.
    mobjects_from_svg(svg)
        Dispatch supported parsed SVG elements to their conversion methods.
    handle_transform(mob, matrix)
        Static method that applies a parsed SVG transformation matrix.
    apply_style_to_mobject(mob, shape)
        Static method that applies parsed fill and stroke styling.
    path_to_mobject(path, svg)
        Convert an SVG path to ``VMobjectFromSVGPath``, including handling
        referenced path geometry.
    line_to_mobject(line)
        Convert a straight SVG line to a Manim ``Line``.
    rect_to_mobject(rect)
        Convert an SVG rectangle to a Manim ``Rectangle`` or
        ``RoundedRectangle``.
    ellipse_to_mobject(ellipse)
        Convert an SVG circle or ellipse to a Manim ``Circle``-based shape.
    polygon_to_mobject(polygon)
        Convert an SVG polygon to a Manim ``Polygon``.
    polyline_to_mobject(polyline)
        Convert an SVG polyline to a Manim ``Polyline``.
    text_to_mobject(text)
        Placeholder for SVG text conversion. The method currently returns
        ``None`` implicitly because its body contains only ``pass``.

    Examples
    --------
    Load an SVG file by filename:

    >>> icon = SVGMobject("my_icon.svg")
    >>> icon.get_height()
    2.0

    The default target height is 2.0 unless overridden by the class or
    constructor configuration.

    Load SVG markup directly from a string:

    >>> svg = '''
    ... <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" height="100">
    ...   <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="red"/>
    ... </svg>
    ... '''
    >>> icon = SVGMobject(svg_string=svg)

    Set a custom height and center the imported object:

    >>> icon = SVGMobject(
    ...     "my_icon.svg",
    ...     height=3.0,
    ...     should_center=True,
    ... )

    Set a custom width and apply a fill override:

    >>> icon = SVGMobject(
    ...     "my_icon.svg",
    ...     width=4.0,
    ...     fill_color=BLUE,
    ... )

    Override both fill and stroke using a general color:

    >>> icon = SVGMobject(
    ...     "my_icon.svg",
    ...     color=YELLOW,
    ...     stroke_width=2.0,
    ... )

    Configure default SVG styling:

    >>> icon = SVGMobject(
    ...     "my_icon.svg",
    ...     svg_default={
    ...         "color": None,
    ...         "opacity": None,
    ...         "fill_color": BLUE,
    ...         "fill_opacity": 1.0,
    ...         "stroke_width": 1.0,
    ...         "stroke_color": WHITE,
    ...         "stroke_opacity": 1.0,
    ...     },
    ... )

    Customize path conversion:

    >>> icon = SVGMobject(
    ...     "my_icon.svg",
    ...     path_string_config={
    ...         # Add supported VMobjectFromSVGPath options here.
    ...     },
    ... )

    Use the SVG mobject in a scene:

    >>> icon = SVGMobject("my_icon.svg", height=2.5)
    >>> icon.shift(LEFT)
    >>> self.add(icon)
    >>> self.play(icon.animate.scale(1.2).shift(RIGHT))

    Inspect the parsed geometry:

    >>> icon = SVGMobject("my_icon.svg")
    >>> len(icon.submobjects)
    >>> icon.get_width(), icon.get_height()

    Notes on Parameter Behavior
    ---------------------------
    The constructor uses ``height = height or self.height`` and
    ``width = width or self.width``. Therefore, values such as ``0`` are
    treated as requests to use the class or instance defaults rather than
    as literal target dimensions.

    Centering occurs before height and width resizing. If ``should_center``
    is false, the original placement is retained before resizing; scaling
    may therefore preserve a placement relative to the origin that differs
    from the centered case.

    If both a target height and target width are provided, the height is
    applied first and the width second. These operations can change the
    aspect ratio because the second resize may stretch the object to the
    requested width independently of its height.

    The final color/style overrides are applied after the geometry and stroke
    widths have been processed. SVG-specific style values may therefore be
    overridden by the explicit constructor parameters.

    The method ``text_to_mobject`` is not a functioning text converter.
    SVG text support should not be assumed merely because the method exists.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Raised explicitly if neither a nonempty SVG string nor a usable
        filename is available. File-reading, XML parsing, SVG parsing, and
        geometry-conversion errors may also propagate from the underlying
        functions and libraries.
