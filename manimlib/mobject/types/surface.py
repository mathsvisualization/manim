class Surface(Mobject):
    """
    A parametrically defined surface represented by a two-dimensional grid
    of three-dimensional points.

    `Surface` inherits from :class:`Mobject` and represents a surface using
    a regular grid sampled over two parameter ranges, ``u_range`` and
    ``v_range``. Each grid point is mapped to a three-dimensional position
    by ``uv_func(u, v)``. The GPU vertex shader uses these sampled points to
    construct the surface mesh, expanding each grid cell into two triangles.

    The class also supports grid resampling, interpolation between surfaces,
    opacity detection, triangle sorting, normal calculation, partial surface
    creation, and coloring based on parameter coordinates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    color : ManimColor, optional
        Base color used to initialize the surface. Defaults to GREY.
    shading : Tuple[float, float, float], optional
        Shading parameters forwarded to Mobject. Defaults to (0.3, 0.2, 0.4).
    depth_test : bool, optional
        Whether depth testing is enabled. Defaults to True.
    u_range : Tuple[float, float], optional

        relative to the camera when the drawing system supports this option.
        Defaults to False.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded to Mobject.

        Structured point data containing three-dimensional positions and
        RGBA colors.
    uniform_dtype : np.dtype
        Shader uniform layout containing common uniforms and the two-component
        surface resolution.

    Examples
    --------
    Define a simple surface using a custom parameterization:

        class PlaneSurface(Surface):
            def uv_func(self, u, v):
                return (u, v, 0.0)

        surface = PlaneSurface(
            u_range=(-2, 2),
            v_range=(-1, 1),
            resolution=(20, 10),
        )

    Create a spherical surface by mapping parameters to 3D coordinates:

        class SphereSurface(Surface):
            def uv_func(self, u, v):
                return (
                    np.cos(u) * np.sin(v),
                    np.sin(u) * np.sin(v),
                    np.cos(v),
                )

        sphere = SphereSurface(
            u_range=(0, TAU),
            v_range=(0, PI),
            resolution=(50, 30),
        )

    Change the sampling resolution:

        surface.set_resolution((40, 40))

    Resample an existing grid while interpolating its stored data:

        surface.resample((60, 60))

    Convert a parameter pair to a point on the sampled surface:

        point = surface.uv_to_point(0.5, 0.5)

    Retrieve the sampled parameter grid:

        uv_grid = surface.get_uv_grid()

    Check whether the stored points still form a regular grid:

        if surface.has_grid():
            print(surface.get_resolution())

    Check surface opacity:

        opaque = surface.is_opaque()
        minimum_opacity = surface.min_opacity()

    Calculate unit normals at sampled points:

        normals = surface.get_unit_normals()

    Color the surface according to its parameter coordinates:

        surface.color_by_uv_function(
            lambda u, v: interpolate_color(BLUE, RED, u)
        )

    Sort surface triangles relative to the camera:

        surface.set_sort_to_camera(True)

    Create a partial surface from another surface:

        partial = Surface()
        partial.pointwise_become_partial(
            surface,
            0.2,
            0.8,
            axis=1,
        )

    Methods
    -------
    init_uniforms()
        Initialize shader uniforms, including the configured grid resolution.

    get_resolution()
        Return the current resolution as a pair of integers obtained from
        the resolution uniform.

    set_resolution(resolution)
        Update the resolution uniform. The new resolution must remain
        consistent with the number and arrangement of stored point records.

    interpolate(mobject1, mobject2, alpha, path_func=straight_path)
        Interpolate the object's data between two mobjects while preserving
        this surface's current resolution.

    uv_func(u, v)
        Map a parameter pair to a three-dimensional point. Subclasses should
        override this method to define their geometry.

    init_points()
        Generate the initial grid of points by evaluating ``uv_func`` over
        the sampled parameter grid.

    get_uv_grid()
        Return an array with shape ``(nu, nv, 2)`` containing all sampled
        parameter pairs.

    uv_to_point(u, v)
        Approximate a surface point by interpolating between nearby sampled
        grid points corresponding to the supplied parameters.

    has_grid()
        Return whether the stored data contains exactly the expected number
        of records for a valid grid with both resolution dimensions greater
        than one.

    resample(resolution)
        Resample all stored floating-point fields over a grid of a different
        resolution, then update the data and resolution uniform.

    align_points(mobject)
        Align two compatible surfaces by resampling both to the maximum
        resolution along each axis. Otherwise, use the parent alignment
        implementation.

    min_opacity()
        Return the minimum alpha value among all stored RGBA records, or
        1.0 if the surface has no records.

    is_opaque()
        Return whether the surface is fully opaque, recalculating the answer
        when the underlying point data version changes.

    get_triangles()
        Return triangle starting indices and triangle centers for sorting.
        Handles both regular grid data and non-grid mesh data.

    set_sort_to_camera(sort=True)
        Set the camera-sorting flag on every Surface in the object's family.

    always_sort_to_camera(camera=None)
        Compatibility method that enables camera sorting. The camera argument
        is not used.

    get_unit_normals()
        Calculate approximate unit normals at the sampled grid points using
        finite differences along the two parameter directions.

    pointwise_become_partial(smobject, a, b, axis=None)
        Make this surface represent a partial interval of another Surface
        along the selected grid axis.

    get_partial_points_array(points, a, b, resolution, axis)
        Produce a point array representing a partial parameter interval,
        interpolating boundary rows or columns at the interval endpoints.

    color_by_uv_function(uv_to_color)
        Assign colors by evaluating a color function at every sampled
        parameter pair.

    Notes
    -----
    - The resolution is stored in shader uniforms. ``get_resolution`` reads
      from those uniforms rather than treating ``initial_resolution`` as
      the current resolution.
    - For a grid with resolution ``(nu, nv)``, the surface stores ``nu * nv``
      point records. The grid has ``(nu - 1) * (nv - 1)`` rectangular cells,
      each expanded into two triangles by the shader.
    - Both resolution dimensions must exceed one for ``has_grid`` to return
      True. The stored record count must also equal ``nu * nv``.
    - ``uv_to_point`` clamps normalized parameter coordinates to the [0, 1]
      interval before selecting nearby grid points. It performs interpolation
      across the sampled grid, rather than evaluating ``uv_func`` directly.
    - ``resample`` interpolates the complete floating-point record data,
      not only point coordinates, so associated color fields are resampled too.
    - ``align_points`` uses the finer resolution along each axis when both
      objects are valid grids. This avoids padding a coarser grid with
      repeated points, which could distort the resulting mesh.
    - ``is_opaque`` checks the minimum alpha value. A surface is considered
      opaque only when every stored alpha value is at least 1.0. The result
      is cached against the point-data version.
    - ``get_triangles`` uses triangle centers rather than a fixed corner
      for sorting, avoiding dependence on the orientation of the parameterization.
    - For grid data, ``get_triangles`` returns two triangle centers per grid
      cell. For non-grid data, it treats consecutive groups of three points
      as triangles and ignores any incomplete trailing group.
    - ``get_unit_normals`` estimates tangent directions with NumPy's gradient
      function, takes their cross product, and normalizes the results.
      Degenerate directions are replaced using neighboring grid directions
      where possible.
    - ``pointwise_become_partial`` copies the full source points when the
      requested interval covers the entire [0, 1] range. Otherwise, it
      updates the point field using ``get_partial_points_array``.
    - ``get_partial_points_array`` expects an axis of 0 or 1. It interpolates
      at the lower and upper interval boundaries while collapsing points
      outside the selected interval toward those boundaries.
    - ``color_by_uv_function`` evaluates its callable with two positional
      arguments, ``u`` and ``v``, for each sampled parameter pair, despite
      the callable annotation being written as ``Callable[[Vect2], Color]``.
    - The default ``uv_func`` produces the flat mapping ``(u, v, 0.0)``.
      Subclasses normally override it to define a meaningful surface.

class ParametricSurface(Surface):
    """
    A surface defined by a user-provided parametric function of two variables.

    `ParametricSurface` inherits from :class:`Surface` and allows the surface
    geometry to be specified by passing a callable that maps a pair of
    parameters ``(u, v)`` to a point in three-dimensional space.

    The supplied function is stored as ``passed_uv_func``. Whenever the
    parent class samples the surface, the overridden ``uv_func`` delegates
    the calculation to this callable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uv_func : Callable[[float, float], Iterable[float]]
        Function that accepts two parameters, ``u`` and ``v``, and returns
        an iterable of coordinates representing a point on the surface.
        Typically, the returned coordinates are ``(x, y, z)``.
    u_range : tuple[float, float], optional
        Start and end values of the first parameter. Defaults to (0, 1).
    v_range : tuple[float, float], optional
        Start and end values of the second parameter. Defaults to (0, 1).
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded to :class:`Surface`, such as
        ``resolution``, ``color``, ``shading``, ``depth_test``, and
        ``sort_to_camera``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    passed_uv_func : Callable[[float, float], Iterable[float]]
        The original parametric function supplied to the constructor.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a flat rectangular surface:

        surface = ParametricSurface(
            lambda u, v: (u, v, 0),
            u_range=(-2, 2),
            v_range=(-1, 1),
        )

    Create a curved surface:

        surface = ParametricSurface(
            lambda u, v: (
                u,
                v,
                np.sin(u) * np.cos(v),
            ),
            u_range=(-PI, PI),
            v_range=(-PI, PI),
            resolution=(50, 50),
        )

    Create a spherical surface using angular parameters:

        sphere = ParametricSurface(
            lambda u, v: (
                np.cos(u) * np.sin(v),
                np.sin(u) * np.sin(v),
                np.cos(v),
            ),
            u_range=(0, TAU),
            v_range=(0, PI),
            resolution=(60, 30),
        )

    Create a helicoidal surface:

        surface = ParametricSurface(
            lambda u, v: (
                v * np.cos(u),
                v * np.sin(u),
                u,
            ),
            u_range=(0, TAU),
            v_range=(0, 2),
            resolution=(60, 30),
        )

    Notes
    -----
    - The callable is stored in ``passed_uv_func`` before the parent
      constructor runs, allowing the inherited surface initialization to
      call the overridden ``uv_func``.
    - The overridden ``uv_func`` simply returns the result of
      ``passed_uv_func(u, v)``. It does not perform additional coordinate
      transformations or validate the returned coordinates.
    - The function should return coordinates compatible with the surface's
      three-dimensional point representation.
    - The parameter ranges determine the interval sampled by the parent
      class, while the ``resolution`` keyword controls how many samples
      are taken along each parameter direction.
    - The resulting geometry is sampled and stored as a grid. Changing the
      callable later does not automatically regenerate the existing points;
      the surface must be reinitialized or its points regenerated for the
      new function to affect the geometry.

class TexturedSurface(Surface):
    """
    A surface that maps one or more image textures onto the geometry of an
    existing Surface.

    `TexturedSurface` inherits from :class:`Surface` and uses another surface
    to define its geometry, parameter ranges, and sampling resolution. Instead
    of storing an RGBA color for every point, it stores texture coordinates
    and opacity values. The GPU shader samples the supplied image textures
    to determine the visible colors across the surface.

    The class supports a light texture and an optional dark texture, allowing
    different images to be used for light and dark rendering modes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uv_surface : Surface
        Surface providing the geometry, parameterization, ranges, shading,
        and initial resolution. Must be an instance of Surface.
    image_file : str
        Path or filename of the primary image texture. Its resolved path is
        loaded as the ``LightTexture``.
    dark_image_file : str or None, optional
        Optional image texture used as the ``DarkTexture``. If omitted,
        the primary image is used for both texture slots and ``num_textures``
        is set to 1. If supplied, ``num_textures`` is set to 2.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded to :class:`Surface`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    uv_surface : Surface
        Source surface whose sampled geometry is used by this object.
    uv_func : Callable
        Reference to the source surface's ``uv_func``.
    u_range : Tuple[float, float]
        Parameter range copied from the source surface.
    v_range : Tuple[float, float]
        Parameter range copied from the source surface.
    initial_resolution : Tuple[int, int]
        Initial sampling resolution copied from the source surface.
    num_textures : int
        Number of active textures indicated to the shader: 1 when no separate
        dark image is supplied, otherwise 2.
    data_dtype : np.dtype
        Structured data layout containing point coordinates, two-dimensional
        image coordinates, and per-point opacity.
    uniform_dtype : np.dtype
        Shader uniform layout containing common uniforms, surface resolution,
        and the number of active textures.
    shader_file : str
        Shader filename used for rendering: ``textured_surface.wgsl``.

    Examples
    --------
    Apply an image texture to a parametric surface:

        surface = ParametricSurface(
            lambda u, v: (u, v, 0),
            u_range=(-2, 2),
            v_range=(-1, 1),
            resolution=(100, 100),
        )

        textured = TexturedSurface(
            surface,
            "texture.png",
        )

    Provide a separate dark-mode texture:

        textured = TexturedSurface(
            surface,
            image_file="light_texture.png",
            dark_image_file="dark_texture.png",
        )

    Change how surface parameters map to texture coordinates:

        textured.set_image_coords_by_uv_func(
            lambda u, v: (u, 1 - v)
        )

    Set the surface opacity:

        textured.set_opacity(0.5)

    Supply different opacity values for the sampled points:

        textured.set_opacity(np.linspace(0.2, 1.0, 100))

    Change opacity through the color interface:

        textured.set_color(None, opacity=0.7)

    Methods
    -------
    init_points()
        Copy the source surface's point positions and resolution, transfer
        its alpha values into the opacity field, and generate image
        coordinates over the normalized texture domain. The v-coordinate
        sampling order is reversed to account for image-coordinate orientation.

    set_image_coords_by_uv_func(uv_func)
        Remap each normalized texture coordinate pair through a callable
        that accepts ``(u, v)`` and returns a new pair ``(u_prime, v_prime)``.

    init_uniforms()
        Initialize the inherited uniforms and set ``num_textures`` for the
        shader.

    min_opacity()
        Return the minimum stored opacity, or 1.0 if there are no records.

    set_opacity(opacity, recurse=True)
        Set per-point opacity values, resizing the supplied values through
        interpolation to match the number of records.

    set_color(color, opacity=None, recurse=True)
        Preserve the texture's colors. If opacity is supplied, update the
        opacity values; the color argument itself does not recolor the texture.

    pointwise_become_partial(tsmobject, a, b, axis=None)
        Apply the inherited partial-surface operation and copy the source
        object's texture coordinates, with additional handling intended to
        keep texture mapping aligned with the partial geometry.

    Notes
    -----
    - The constructor checks ``uv_surface`` with ``isinstance`` and raises
      an Exception if the supplied object is not a Surface.
    - Both texture slots are created even when only one image is supplied.
      In that case, the same image file is used for LightTexture and
      DarkTexture, while ``num_textures`` remains 1.
    - The source surface provides the geometry. ``init_points`` copies its
      point coordinates instead of evaluating ``uv_func`` independently.
    - The source surface's RGBA alpha channel is copied into the new
      object's opacity field during point initialization.
    - Texture coordinates are generated from normalized values between
      0 and 1. The v-coordinate values are enumerated from 1 down to 0
      to reverse the vertical image-coordinate direction.
    - ``set_image_coords_by_uv_func`` changes the texture-coordinate mapping,
      not the geometric point positions. The callable is evaluated for
      every normalized coordinate pair.
    - ``min_opacity`` considers only the stored opacity field. It does not
      account for transparency that may already exist in the source image.
    - ``set_opacity`` interpolates the provided values to the number of
      point records. Its ``recurse`` parameter is accepted but not used.
    - ``set_color`` does not apply the supplied color because visible colors
      are sampled from the texture. Only its optional opacity argument has
      an effect.
    - ``pointwise_become_partial`` defaults to the inherited preferred
      creation axis when ``axis`` is None.
    - In the supplied implementation, the partial-texture-coordinate section
      references ``im_coords`` without defining it locally or qualifying it
      as ``self.data["im_coords"]``. Unless ``im_coords`` exists in the
      surrounding scope, a partial interval may raise a NameError. This
      section should be checked before relying on partial textured surfaces.
